## Clarifai 
## Overview and Origin

Clarifai was founded in 2013 by Matthew Zeiler, Ph.D., a foremost expert in 
machine learning. 

Matthew did a research about neural networks applied to understanding 
images automatically, the initial results from his experiement were promissing,
so he started working in a real world application and build a simple demo,
he would take pictures with his cellphone and it would give reasonable results,
what he accomplished atonished him, so he came up to realize that tool could 
be useful to the world, where there are multiple images and videos that his 
tool could help to understand.
 
Clarifi has received inversions from different companies, such as: 

    1. CPP Investments  
    2. Corazon capital 
    3. GV 
    4. LDV Capital 
    5. LUX 
    6. NEA
    7. NEXTEquity

## Busines Activities 
 
Clarifai initially offered a solution for visual search, using machine learning 
and deep natural networks to identify and analyse images automatically. 
It has evolved to the point currently it offers a full stack AI platform for 
exploration, data labeling, model training evaluation and inference around images,
video text and audio data. This way enterprises and public sector organizations
can extract insights rapidly from their unstructured data, and in doing so, 
increase the value of their data, human capital and reduce AI expenses.  
 
The market for Clarifai is all industry related to manufacturing, media and 
entertainment, retail, and Ecommerce and even Transportation. 
Any business with the necessity of content moderation, digital asset management, 
intelligence, surveillance, product discovery, and visual inspection can benefit 
from what Clarifai has to offer.  
 
Base on Forrester’s evaluation of the emerging market for computer vision platforms,
following statement are what make Clarifai be outstanding from their competitors.
 
    ¨›Offers military-grade computer vision. A pioneer in deep learning-based 
    computer vision, Clarifai can tackle near-real-time visual search, facial 
    recognition use cases, and deployment in the most secure, air-gapped environments 
    that nearly all other vendors can’t match. 
    
    ›Is on its way to becoming a self-service computer vision platform. 
    For now, Clarifai’s workbench offers an easy-to-use but limited set of 
    capabilities for labelling data and developing custom models. 
    The rest of its capabilities are through professional services. 
    
    ›Is a particularly good fit for security, surveillance, and safety use cases. 
    Need secure custom models that can be trained continuously and do extremely 
    fast visual search? Clarifai should be on your list, whether you’re a 
    government entity or enterprise. 
    Clarifai Customer Reference Summary Customers praise Clarifai for its 
    helpful staff and variety of pretrained models, but some expressed diffculty 
    with troubleshooting technical problems and keeping models up to date¨
 
The technologies Clarifai is currently utilizing by category are: 
Application and Data: 
JavaScript, Python, HTML5, React, Less, Android SDK, Golang, Objective, Amazon Redshift 
 
Utilities: 
Google Analytics,  Postman,  Stack Overflow, Twilio and Mailgun

## Landscape
 
Clarifai is an independent artificial intelligence company that specializes in 
computer vision, natural language processing, and audio recognition, in recent 
years Clarifai has focused on develop and offer a full stack plataform that 
manage all the necessesary components and tools for developing, deploying and 
managing artificial inteligence. 
 
In the last 10 years Clarifai has been recognized several times across different
areas. The most remarkables are listed below:
 
In 2014, their deep learning API was a pioneer in the field. With one model to 
recognize 10,000 different concepts (10x larger than Imagenet), they had what 
could be considered the first foundation model in today's vernacular. 
 
Clarifai recognized for Vision, Language and autoML Use Cases in the latest 2023 
Gartner® Critical Capabilities for Cloud AI Developer Services for 2 times in a row.
 
Clarifai more outstanding Competitors are:

        Landing AI 
        Amazon Rekognition 
        Open CV 
        DeepVision 
        Azure Face API

## Results
Clarifai revolutioned the visual search along with data labeling, and continues 
to do so in other areas of AI, offering a full stack AI Platform which uses: 
        
        -Model safety, Model supervision AI Observability Synthetic Data, 
        -Data labeling 
        -Fine tunning Transfer Learning 
        -Orchestration – Vector Database 
        -Frameworks (eg Pytorch, Tensorflow)

        -Infra: Cloud Hosting, On Premise, Inference
 
In the Ai world the evaluation criteria to determined the success and outstanding 
job based on Forrester's report are: 

    "1. Data: What capabilities exist to annotate and label training data; 
    preprocess and augment data; protect sensitive data during annotation; 
    visualize and describe the distribution and other attributes of the data; a
    nd validate models against test and ground truth data sets? How wide a 
    variety of inputs does the platform support? 

    2. Capabilities: What capabilities does the platform have to support common 
    image analysis tasks? What capabilities does it have to support tasks specific 
    to video analysis? What are the platform’s capabilities to support 
    augmented/virtual/mixed reality and image generation tasks, if any?

    3. Pretrained models: What pretrained models exist for extracting insights 
    from image/video; face detection/recognition/analysis; OCR and handwriting 
    detection and recognition; extracting structured data; or other types of 
    document analysis? What other domain-specific models and languages does the 
    platform support?

    4. Deployment: What are the platform’s features for transfer learning, 
    neural network search, and model performance comparison? What support is 
    there for common neural network framework architectures?

    5. Solutions:  What capabilities exist for designing pipelines or 
    hierarchies of models? What accelerators exist for common vertical or 
    horizontal use cases? What professional services and partnerships does 
    the platform offer? What are its security and interoperability capabilities?

    6. Ease of use: What features exist for continuous improvement, 
    explainability, and sample use cases? What do Forrester and customers 
    think of the user interface? To what degree are developer/data science 
    skills necessary for implementing and maintaining computer vision solutions 
    using the platform?

    7. Vision: How well does the product vision align with customer needs for 
    computer vision? How well does the vision align with current customer trends
     and future customer needs?

    8. Roadmap: What is Forrester’s level of confidence in the vendor’s roadmap 
    to increase adoption by enterprise buyers in terms of planned product

    and capabilities to deliver on its stated roadmap?

    9. Market approach: Is the company executing a successful go-to-market 
    approach? Does the vendor have a well-thought-out technology and channel 
    partner strategy?"
 
Based on Forrester's report, Clarifai is differentiated from others when 
it comes to: 
Capabilities, Pretrained models, Vision, Road map and market approach. 

## Recomendation 

Clarifai has been evaluated against companies like Google and Microsoft wich means it has 
become a leader in AI bussines, however one of the points which was evaluated 
as neutral and has can be a game changing from costumer perpective is the 'ease of use'. 
I inmersed in the website looking for information available to 
start using their tools. One could say it lacks of a intuitive plataform, 
the information is avaialble but the structure is spread. Since Clarifai is a 
Visual oriented company  I would recommend to use their own product as an 
approach for new clientele, videos are available in a separete website like youtube.
Since Clarifai is developed for developers, it focus particularly in show their
technical strenght however a easy view of the final product could help to expand 
and explore new horizons where their tool can be instroduced, specially to 
begginers in the AI field.  

I would integrate the 'final product example' to give the user a more interactive
expirience withouth the need of sign in or create an account, a brief example would be enough.  
it might be integrated with Javascript to stress the benefit and results that one could
achived if clarifai is utilized. 

When people understand the impact of their tool, the use could dramatically increase.
